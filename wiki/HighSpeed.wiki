#summary High Speed screenshots and info.

*High Speed* is a war game with cars for 1 to 4 simultaneous players. It was originally made with DIV Games Studio 2 back in the year 2002, and was ported for the first time to a non-DOS language in 2009.

It is a pretty shitty game, only uploaded for historical reasons.
